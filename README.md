*A Python to NXC Converter for programming LEGO MINDSTORMS Robots*

**pynxc** on GitHub is a continuation of a now stale project to convert Python programs to NXC so that you can use Python to program your NXT robots.

You can find the official site of the old project here: https://code.google.com/p/pynxc/
